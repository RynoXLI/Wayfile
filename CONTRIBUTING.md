## Developer Certificate of Origin

All contributors must sign off on their commits, indicating that they agree to the 
Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). This is done by adding a sign-off line to 
your commit messages.

To sign off, add the following to your commit message:

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>

You can do this automatically by using the `-s` flag with git commit:

git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
